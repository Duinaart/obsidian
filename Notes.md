# Part I: THE M&A ENVIRONMENT
## 1 - Introduction to M&A
### Section 1: M&A as a form of corporate restructuring
Types of restructurings:
1. Corporate restructuring: redeploy assets
	- balance sheet: mergers, break-ups and spin-offs
	- assets only: acquisitions, divestitures etc...

2. Financial restructuring: increase leverage to lower the wacc or share repurchases as takeover defense 

3. Operational restructuring: divestitures, widespread employee reduction or reorganization

**merger** = combination of two or more firms (often comparable in size) in which only one exists afterwards
advantage: legally simple
disadvantage: must be approved by stockholders of both firms
	-> negotiated deals, mutuality of negotiations, mostly friendly

| Legal Term | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| statutory merger | surviving firm automatically assumes all assets and liabilities of the target firm |
| subsidiary merger | - target becomes a subsidiary of the parent <br> - target is operated under its brand name but it is owned and controlled by the acquirer |
| consolidation | new firm is created from combination of existing firms <br> technically not a merger |
| acquisition (takeover) | firm acquired by another firm by buying voting shares <br> tender offer = public offer to buy shares (directly to shareholders), hostile when done without board approval |

horizontal mergers: between firms in the same business activity (eg: AB & Inbev)
 -> economies of schale and scope
 -> synergies (eg: combining of best practices)
 => government regulation necessary due to potential anticompetitive effects

vertical mergers: combinations between firms at different stages
 -> positive: information and transaction efficiency
 -> negative: lack of flexibility/innovation, supplier becomes fixed costs since all supply needs to be sold

conglomerate mergers: mergers between firms in unrelated business activities (eg: GE)
 -> diversification benefits, all BU operate under same brand name

!= investment (holding) companies! they only diversify to reduce portfolio risk and don't strive for synergies/integration... except for financial expertise synergies


### Section 2: Diversification and value destruction

> [!paper] Berger and Ofec (Journal of financial economics, 1995)
> *diversification: evidence of value destruction with conglomerates* <Br>
"document a diversification discount between 13%-15% in the cases of conglomerates who do M&A wanting to diversify"
-> greater value loss if the diversification is unrelated

causes:
- overinvestment: too much investments for sector with little good IRR opportunities
- cross-subsidization: badly parts performing are artificially kept alive by funding of well-performing subsidiaries

methods: analyze segment data of 3,600 firms between 1986-1991
1. single-segment and multi-segment firms
2. collect metrics:
	- total assets
	- total sales
	- EBIT
3. calculate an 'Imputed Value': the value a firm would have if all of its segments operated as stand-alone businesses
4. calculate the excess value as the $ln(\text{actual value}/\text{imputed value})$  

*example: assume a firm with a market value (market value common equity + book value of debt) of €1,500 mio and sales of €100 mio operating in three different segments*
the 'sales * values/sales industry' measures the implied segment value if the segment would be listed or spun-off/carved out

| Sector <br> Code | Sales | Values/sales <br> industry | Sales * <br> Value/sales industry |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 50 | 10 | 500 |
| 2 | 30 | 15 | 450 |
| 3 | 20 | 18 | 360 |
|  | = 100 |  | IV=1,310 |
$$\text{excess value} = ln(1,500/1,310) = 13.54\%$$
-> you can use sales/assets/ebit or whatever else accounting item 

> [!paper] Shin and Stulz (1998)
> 	*Capital misallocation as reason for diversification discount* <Br> 
> "the capex of a segment of diversified firm depends more on the CF generated by other segments than by its own generated CF. However, a segment's sensitivity to other segments' CF does not depend on the investment opportunities"

> [!paper] Rajan, Servaes and Zingales (2000)
> "the misallocation and diversification issues are related to the diversity of investment opportunities"

^6c153a

> [!paper] Lamont (1997)
> 	*Agency argument: overinvestment in underperforming segments*
> "oil firms decrease their investments in non-oil segments when the income falls in the oil segment" -> overinvestment in oil-segment

> [!paper] Palia (1999)
> 	*discount due to agency problems*
> "diversification discount increases as management ownership decreases and board size increases"
> -> management ownership and smaller board is positively correlated

> [!paper] Maksimovic and Philips (2001) 
>  *conglomerate firms are less productive than single-segment firms*
>  (using plant-level data)


### Questioning of value destruction of diversification
**Conglomerates were already different before the diversification**
- diversified firms already trade at discount before further diversification 
  (Campa and Kedia, 2002)
- diversified firms performed already poorly before diversification 
  (Lang and Stulz, 1994)
- Discount is a reflection of differences in expected return (k) and CF 
  (Lamont and Polk, 1999)
- improvements in documented investment efficiency is caused by endogeneity and error in measurement of q -> what is the explaining variable? Perhaps conglomerates diversify since they don't perform as well as other firms. 
  (çolak and Whited, 2005)

### Does diversification create value?
> [!paper] Villalonga (2004)
> *segments of diversified firms are larger than stand-alone firms and thus have lower q ratios*

$$\text{Tobin's Q} = \frac{\text{market value}}{\text{replacement value}} \text{ OR } \frac{\text{market value}}{\text{book value}}$$

*replacement value*: how much would it cost to start again from scratch?
=> lower Q value: lower valuation (undervalued?) 

firms are actually more diversified than they report: 
- only segments >10% of sales/assets/profits are reported
- flexible definition of business segment
- segments are self-reported

-> diversified firms trade at a premium and have better access to capital markets


> [!paper] Volkov and Smith (2015)
>  *Conglomerates perform better in developing countries and in economic downturns*

reasons:
1. they sell at a premium in countries with limited capital market access (have more internal cashflows so less need for capital markets)
2. ability to transfer ideas and technologies among various businesses

### Section 3: Merger waves
types of merger waves:
1. horizontal consolidation 
	- drive for efficiency and technological change
	- lax antitrust law enforcement
2.  increasing concentration (metals, transportation and mining industry)
3. conglomerate era 
	- buy earnings stream to boost share price (accretive deals!)
	- overvalued firms buy smaller undervalued high growth firms
	  -> led to overvaluation of smaller high-growth firms
4. retrenchment era
	- financial buyers (junk bonds) -> financial innovation!
	- small firms buying bigger firms by issuang a large amount of high-yield bonds
	- ended with bankruptcy of large LBOs and Drexel Burnham 
5. strategic megamerger
	- consolidation in industries (lax antitrustlaws)
	- technological innovation 
	  -> dotcom bubble
6. cross border/horizontal megamerger
	- banking, telecommunications, healthcare, utlities
	- wanting to achieve economies of scale and scope 
	- tighter regulation (need economies of scale)
	- low interest rates (easy to find financing)

importance: financial markets reward firms pursuing promising (undervalued) opportunities early and punish those that follow later in the cycle (less attractive valuations)! 
-> strong difference in ROI different stages in cycle

similarities between merger waves:
- periods of high economic growth
- low or declining interest rates
- rising stock market

differences between merger waves:
- emergency of new technology
- industry focus
- types of transaction (horizontal/vertical/conglomerate/strategic/financial)

### Section 4: Why do M&As happen?

**SYNERGIES**
**economies of scale**: average costs decline with larger size 
- higher overall efficiency
- lowered required inventory investment
- easier implementation of specialization
- improved capacity utilization
=> most common in industries with high fixed costs

**economies of scope**
- combining complementary resources (eg data centers)
- production of additional products due to extra experience

**economies of vertical integration**
- control over suppliers/purchasers may reduce costs
  -> watch out for over-integration!

**financial synergies**: lower cost of capital
- co-insurance
- more efficient R&D expenses
- lower cost of debt since more CF

=> make sure that synergy benefits are justify the cost!


*bootstrap game*: give up future growth for immediate earnings:
1. firm with high P/E ratio acquires firm with low P/E ratio through stock-swap
2. EPS will get artificially inflated for acquiring company
3. over time EPS will grow slower than before due to share dilution 
   (issued new shares in order to pay for transaction)

VALUE INCREASING THEORIES
**mergers create synergies**
- economies of scale
- more effective management
- improved production techniques
- combination of complementary resources

**takeovers are disciplinary**
- can be used to remove poor managers 
- facilitate competition between different management teams

VALUE NEUTRAL THEORIES
**managers are prone to excessive self-confidence: overbid for acquisition**
*winner's curse:* winner of bid most likely overpaid for the acquisition
value neutral since loss of acquirer is gain of target

VALUE REDUCING THEORIES
**agency costs of free cashflow**
- FCF is reduced due to merger (large cost)
- firms with FCF are those where internal funds > positive NPV opportunities
	-> managers reinvest FCF inefficiently back into firm 

**managerial entrenchment**
- managers may be hesitant to distribute cash to shareholders
  -> want to use it to perform sub-optimal M&As in order to seem important and 'necessary' to run the empire as they are the only one who knows how to run the group
  => takeover deals financed internally underperform debt financed deals: signal of managerial empire building motives 

reasons M&As fail:
1. overpayment due to overestimation of synergies
2. slow pace of integration
3. poor strategy

### Section 5: M&A returns
SHAREHOLDER RETURN TARGET COMPANY
approaches:
1. event study => see assignment  
   shortcomings: 
  - assumes investors can assess potential synergies
  - ignores potential benefits of strategic acquisitions
  
2. postmerger returns: significantly higher for target than for acquirer
	- higher premium to avoid competing bids
	- more sophisticated takeover defenses push price up

sometimes returns to target shareholders are negative
-> when there has been a run-up due to rumours and the announced offer price is lower than expected

>[!danger] PAYMENT METHODS
Equity: take advantage of temporarily overvalued equity
Debt: used by managers confident about future stock appreciation

targets are less happy to receive shares of bidder:
- uncertainty about future share value
- thinks shares of bidder are overvalued since he prefers this

why do they accept overvalued shares?
- takeover too big to finance with just cash
- overvaluation may not be obvious
- use of shares reduces leverage

SHAREHOLDER RETURN BIDDER
generally: positive about deals
-> except for deals involving large public firms using stock to pay for the deal
positive abnormal return of 1-1.5%
*bias in earlier studies: they only focused on public firms*

bidder returns are more negative in stock deals than cash deals:
- signal of overvaluation
- likelihood of overpaying 'since it's only shares'
- short selling by arbs: exacerbates negative reaction
*less negative reaction in EU due to large blockholders!*

contrary research: use of stock mitigates information asymmetry of target since risk of overpayment is shared with the target's owners

information-opaque firms can be paid in cash instead if:
- target shareholders want to lower their price in exchange of immediate liqiuidity
- acquirer's dominant shareholders want to avoid dilution of control 
  (no new share issuance)

smaller acquirers often realize higher returns than larger acquirers:
- managers may be overconfident since they have done more deals
- incentive system in big firms to do deals (may do worse deals just for incentive)
- CEOs in small firms may be risk averse as they own more shares and only act if it is obvious that it is a good choice
-> in countries with weak corporate governance: positive returns by big bidders as well

small firms less likely to receive overpriced stock:
1. less possibility for diluting large stock overvaluations public firms
2. high fixed transaction costs: not worth it to acquire small firms if only goal is to bootstrap
-> these reasons make them less attractive as well

higher acquirer returns for private company targets:
- limited availability of information
- limited number of bidders due to low liquidity 

higher acquirer return for acquirers in countries with strict corporate governance controls and a target in countries with weaker governance standards
-> they improve the management (practices) in the target company

### Section 6: other aspects
ROLE OF INVESTMENT BANKS
investment banks act as financial advisor:
- reduce transaction costs, information costs and agency costs
- screen the market, identify promising targets and negotiate favorable terms
- build up a reputation and connect you with clients

> [!paper] Want & Lahr (2017)
>>  *stricter takeover regulation increases combined gains*
>
positive effects on targets due to:
>- mandatory bid rule (need to do public bid if position >30%)
>- ownership disclosure rule (blockholders need to disclose positions >5%)
>
positive: more information to shareholders
negative: decrease in number of transactions -> bad management stays in place 


## 3 - Corporate ownership and governance around the world
### Section 1: corporate ownership
> [!paper] Berle and Means (1932)
>>  *ownership of companies is dispersed among small shareholders, but control is concentrated in managers (valid in the US/UK)*
>
>small (retail) owners don't have an incentive or power to control the managers

>[!danger] Agency Problem I
conflict of interest between managers and shareholders because manager wants to receive private benefits
(follows from separation of ownership and control)

> [!paper] La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes and Shleifer (1999)
>  *note that dominant form of ownership is family ownership (valid in Europe)*

>[!danger] **Agency Problem II**
>conflict of interest between blockholders (family) and minority shareholders (eg: more conservative, nepotism, separated voting classes,...)

(Agency Problem I doesn't hold as they have a lot of control over the managers)
they achieve this by having seperate voting classes or use of pyramids
-> separation of voting and cashflow rights!

lower protection for shareholders if there are more mechanisms in place to separate ownership from control

they want to measure the control that individual investors have in the form of the 'antidirector rights index'
-> they find that the US and the UK have much better investor right protection
(countries with family-owned businesses have way worse investor right protection)

-> They constructed a shareholder rights protection index (agency problem I), a minority shareholder rights protection index (agency problem II) and a creditor rights protection 
=> conclusion: the more protection for shareholders, the less protection for creditors or blockholders and vice versa

| Market Model <Br> USA/UK | Control Model <Br> Europe |
| --- | --- |
| liquid capital markets | illiquid capital markets |
| widely dispersed ownership | heavily concentrated ownership |
| largely independent board members | 'insider' board members |
| separate ownership and control | overlapping ownership and control |
| high financial disclosure | limited financial disclosure |
| short-term vision | long-term vision |

### Section 2: corporate governance
**code daems:** listed firms -> comply or explain 
**code buysse:** private firms
=> soft law! leadership and accountability: to protect the rights of corporate stakeholders

board structures:
1. unitary board (belgium): company managers and independent directors
   -> these have no links to major shareholders! this is essential in protecting the interests of smaller shareholders
2. two-tier board: management board consisting only of executives. These are under scrutiny of a supervisory board with only independent directors.

responsibilities board members:
- review management proposals & advice CEO
- hire, fire and set CEO compensation
- oversee management, corporate strategy and financial reports to shareholders

good governance practices:
- seperation of CEO and chairman of the board!
- boards dominated by independent members
- independent members serving on the audit and compensation committees

advantages:
- reduces monitoring costs 
- improves performance
- more likely to replace poorly performing CEO
- more likely to choose outside CEO
- better acquisitions (no CEO hubris)
- more intensive bargaining when company becomes takeover target

potential conflicts of interest (as board member):
- past employment as executive
- consulting or contractual agreement
- relatives of top management
- commercial banker -> they don't want the firm to take on extra risk (good for shareholder but bad for debtholder)
- directors with interlocked directorships -> board members that hold seats in other firms might do favours for eachother
- CEO should not be the chairman of the board (harder replacement)

good to have on the board:
- representatives of large shareholders can have a positive impact! (if not too many)
- former politicians and regulators (know how the game works)
- adding the CFO to the board gives better insight into firm activities

directors with multiple board seats have strong reputations and good network
-> firms with board members with multiple board seats are less likely to be target of hostile bid, extract higher takeover premiums and are less likely to be sued for financial fraud

downside: busy directors are correlated with excessive CEO compensation

board should be relatively small and meet as often as situation requires

CEO should be compensated in stock in order to promote managerial ownership 
-> balance between reduced agency costs (agency problem I) and increased agency problems due to large blockholders (agency problem II)

Board members could also be paid in stock in order to align interests of directors with those of the shareholders -> may see management more actively


### Section 3: corporate control & takeovers
management may resist takeover bids in order to:
- increase the purchase price: *shareholders interests theory*
- ensure longevity with firm: *management entrenchment theory*

takeovers may:
- decrease agency costs
- transfer control to those who can more efficiently manage the assets

hostile deals are rare due to the:
- flexibility of the board in setting up takeover defenses
- impact on bid premiums (way higher)
- impact on postclosing integration (way harder)
-> threat of hostile bids often moves target boards toward negotiated settlements

HOSTILE TAKEOVER TACTICS AND DEFENCES
hostile takeover tactics
- limiting target's actions through a "bear hug"
  (informal offer to acquire shares at a premium, made public without board consent)
- proxy contests in support of takeover
- purchasing target stock in the open market
- circumventing the target's board through a tender offer
- litigation 

hostile takeover defenses:
- poison pill to raise the cost of takeover
- strenghtening the target board's defences:
	- staggered or classified board elections: only allow certain board members to be removed every year (integration takes a long time)
	- limiting conditions on when directors can be removed 
	  (less attractive for takeovers since they cannot install new board)
- limiting shareholder actions
	- limitations on calling special meetings
	- limiting consent sollicitations
- other methods:
	- anti greenmail provision: provision that prevents the board of directors from making greenmail payments, in order to discourage investors who just want to threaten the board and sell shares back at a premium
	- fair price provision: requirement that bidders pay a 'fair price' in attempt to discourage hostile takeovers and to protect minority shareholders
	- super-voting stock: some investors have veto rights
	- re-incorporation: change laws when threatened with hostile takeover
	- golden parachutes: large premiums that need to be paid to board members and CEO if they get fired (after takeover for example)

post-offer takeover defenses:
- greenmail
- standstill agreement
- pac-man defense: take over the bidder
- white knights: someone who saves the target
- employee stock ownership plans: they own shares and are loyal to management
- recapitalization: assume more debt
- share buy-back plans

main goals:
1. raise the overall cost of the takeover to the acquirer's shareholders
2. increase the time required to finalize transaction, giving target more time




# Part II: THE M&A PROCESS
## 4 - Developing Business & acquisition plans
Phases of the acquisition process:
1. busines plan         ---|
2. acquisition plan        |
3. search                  |-> Pre-Purchase decision activities   
4. screen                  |
5. first contact           |
6. negotiation          ---|
7. integration plan     ---|
8. closing                 |
9. integration             |-> Post-Purchase decision activities
10. evaluation          ---|

**phase 1: business plan**
1. industry/market definition: internal (SWOT) and external (5 forces) analysis
2. business mission and vision
   (eg: Amazon wishes to be perceived by consumers as the preferred online department store by 20XX)
3. corporate (growth/diversification/...) and business (cost/focus/...) strategies
4. implementation strategies (solo ventures/mer-acq/alliance/minority investment)

**phase 2: acquisition plan**
1. plan objectives: support the realization of key business plan objectives
   (eg: firm needs higher return, acquire a target with high ROA)
2. make timetable for acquisition
3. maintain a good resource and capability oversight
4. incorporate management preferences
5. set up a search plan incorporating all the preferences
6. conceive negotiation strategy
7. determine initial offer price
8. set up a financing plan
9. set up an integration plan


## 5 - Search Through Closing
**phase 3: search**
1. establish primary selection criteria (industry, max transaction size, market segment, product line, leverage, profitability,...)
2. develop a search strategy to identify potential targets

-> get help of finders and brokers

*broker:* has a fiduciary responsibility to the seller or buyer
*finder:* introduces both parties without representing either party

fee structures are negotiated (basic fee, closing fee & extraordinary fee)

**phase 4: refining screening process**
increase the number of selection criteria to narrow down shortlist

**phase 5: first contact**
appropriate strategy approach depends on size of target, private or public company, timeframe of transaction, amout of trust already present,...

legal documents:
- teaser
- confidentiality agreements
- term sheets (for brokers)
- letter of intent

**phase 6: negotiation & due diligence**
1. determine areas of agreement and disagreement
2. solve easiest part of agreement first
-> important to maintain trust throughout the process!

at the same time:
- deal structuring
- valuation agreement
- conducting due diligence !important!
- develop financing plan

key considerations:
- form of acquisition
- form of payment
- tax considerations
- accounting considerations (what is EBITDA,...)
- acquisition vehicle 
- post-closing organization
- legal forms of selling entity

**phase 7: integration plan**
use due diligence to determine post-closing plan
=> use a master schedule to guide work teams to clear all the roadblocks (new software, accounting systems, providers, contract related issues,...)

**phase 8: closing**
obtain all necessary consents:
- shareholder
- !regulator!
- third parties

complete the definitive agreement with all the bells and whistles
(assumption liabilities, covenants, loan documents, warranties,...)

**phase 9: integration**
implement the integration plan -> employee retention is important!
solid cash flow necessary, communicate clearly, solve cultural issues

**phase 10: evaluation**
don't change the performance benchmarks and ask difficult questions!


## 6 - M&A postclosing integration
factors affecting successful integration:
- pace of integration
- integration planning
- effective communication
- customer focus
- make tough decisions early
- focus on highest leverage issues

view integration as a process:
- integration planning
- develop communication plans: with employees, customers, suppliers and investors
- create a new organization: learn from the past and organize structure
- develop staffing plans
- functional integration
- integrate corporate cultures


# PART III: M&A VALUATION AND MODELLING
## 7/10 - valuation basics
**VALUATION MULTIPLES**
value = financial parameter x multiple
multiples on Enterprise Value (EV):
- EV/EBITDA
- EV/EBIT
- EV/sales
-> advantages: used often, easy, take into account debt
disadvantages: normalised EBITDA, only 1 moment, EV/sales doesn't incorporate margins

equity multiples:
- P/E = market cap/net current earnings
- P/CF = market cap/cash flow
- P/BV = market cap/book value
-> advantages: used often, easy
disadvantages: find normalised profit, only for profitable firms, only 1 moment

caveats:
- average vs median
- composition of peer group
- consisten use of sources
- take into account exceptional elements
- goodwill
- long term growth
- timing of investments

PEG = Price/Earnings to growth (useful when differences in growth rates)
- PEG < 1: undervalued, PEG=1: fairly valued, PEG>1: overvalued

**TRANSACTION MULTIPLES**
major limitation: truly comparable and very recent transactions are rare
! valuations based on this method already include a purchase price premium!

transaction multiples often reflect a control premium, also:
- dissimilar cost and revenue synergies
- replacement of management team
- financial re-engineering: increasing debt level
- buying of marketshare

deal specific elements:
- does valuation include an earn-out?
- are there off-balance sheet liabilities? (litigation, environmental issues)
- is normalization of financial data necessary?
- has it happened in a fire sale?

**ASSET BASED METHODS**
tangible book value = total assets - total liabilities - goodwill
-> often used for financial services firms and distribution firms (large current assets)

liquidation method: value assets as if they are sold in an orderly fashion
-> difficult to do without proper extensive expertise in specific area

break-up value: units viewed as series of independent operating units, 
aggregate equity value of business = sum(equity values) - group level liabilities and break-up costs

replacement cost method: how much would it cost to replace that asset, sum of each asset's value

**LEVERAGE**
once revenue > fixed costs: increase in revenue leads to way higher increase in profits
-> high fixed to total cost ratios magnify fluctuations in financial returns as only a small percentage of revenue (excess of fixed costs) flows to pretax profits

increase in debt leads to lower net income (after interest payments) but to higher return on equity as interest payments are fixed

in absence of debt: $\beta=\beta_u$ (unlevered beta)
 -> impacted by firms operating leverage and cyclicality business
in presence of debt: $\beta = \beta_l$ (levered beta) $\Rightarrow \beta_u < \beta_l$

- increasing D/E raises firms breakeven revenue and increases the shareholder risk (returns<required returns) since more cashflow goes to debt payments
- tax deductability of interest decreases risk to shareholders

**VALUATION CASH FLOW**
(parate kennis en niet nodig voor het examen want in taak verwerkt)

**DEFERRED TAXES**
when book value > value accepted by tax authorities
-> analyst has overestimated future tax shield so company has to report a deferred tax liability -> becomes a 'deferred tax payment'

**OFF BALANCE LEASE ACTIVITIES**
*operational lease:* lease payment is cost in income statement and is off-balance sheet
*financial lease:* asset on balance hseet dat is depreciated against a lease debt on which interest will be paid

Asset: PV(lease payments)   | liability: lease debt
sales - costs (operational lease) - (depreciation + depr. on PV(lease)) = EBIT 

**OFF BALANCE INTANGIBLE ASSETS**
EX: CAPITALIZING R&D EXPENSES
-> take R&D out of income statement (costs), capitalize it and add it to assets
-> costs will go down (profit up) and assets will go up as well
-> deferred tax liability since 

**VALUING PRIVATE COMPANIES**
in Europe, 99% of the firms are SME's (<250 employees) with 80% being family owned

criteria for family-owned business:
- family has controlling ownership
- management involvement
- succession (next generation)

challenges of family firms:
- succession: willigness of CEO and of next generation
- access to capital: prefer internal financing + don't do equity issuance
- lack of corporate governance
- informal management structure
- less skilled lower management (nepotism)
- preference for ownership over growth
- amenity potential: want benefits besides financial benefits that only the family receives (status, name recognition)
  -> may accept lower performance for higher socio-emotional wealth

benefits of family firms:
- incentive to monitor managers (no agency I problem)
- lower agency costs (family is part of mgmt + trusted employees)
- long term profit maximization

family ownership creates value when:
- founder serves as CEO
- CEO as chairman of board in combination with professional CEO

higher family ownership is associated with less acquisitions.
agency perspective:
- lower asymmetry between managers and owners
- entrenchment: having less capable family member managers limits ability to make complex acquisitions
family perspective:
- objective to retain control
- avoid disruption of close social relationships with stakeholders
-> however, they do like to make diversifying acquisitions in order to diversify wealth

**valuation of private companies:**
they normally overstate expenses and understate revenue (tax purposes), but the opposite is true when they are trying to sell their business (need to look good)

smaller firms have higher total betas than capm betas since they are not well diversified and are thus concerned about market risk as well as idiosyncratic risk -> they thus require a higher return and have accordingly a higher beta 

adjust value for 
- liquidity risk (discount)
- value of control (premium): when buying majority control
- minority risk (discount): when buying minority control -> interconnected with synergy premium since majority control might be necessary in order to achieve them
  -> is lower in liquid markets since dissatisfied investors can just sell their stake

minority shareholders are illiquid because:
- they cannot force the sale of the business
- controlling shareholders have little to gain by buying their shares
=> positive corr between liquidity discounts, control premium and minority discount


> [!example] example 1
operating profit = $150,000
transaction multiple = 6 x operating profit
liquidity discount = 20%
control premium = 30% (synergies)
>
how much to pay maximaly for 50.1% stake in the firm?
>
EV = $150,000\*6=$900,000
max payment = $900,000*(1+30%)*(1-20%)\*50.1% = $468,936


>[!example] example 2
equity value = $18,699,493
synergies = $2,250,000 (cost savings due to partnerships)
liquidity discount = 16%
control premium = 10% 
minority discount = 9%
>
how much to pay maximally for 50.1% stake in the firm?
max payment = ($18,699,493+$2,250,000)\*(1+10%)*(1-16%)\*50.1% = $9,689,023
>
how much to pay maximally for 20% stake in the firm?
max payment = ($18,699,493)*(1-9%)(1-16%)\*20% = $2,855,637


# Part IV: DEAL STRUCTURING AND FINANCING STRATEGIES
## 13 - Financing the deal

Forms of financing:
(tranches of capital: descending order of seniority)
1. Revolving Credit Facility ('revolver') 
	- form of senior bank debt that acts as credit card of company
	- used to fund company's working capital needs
	- costs: interest on drawn balance + commitment fee undrawn balance

2. Bank debt (secured) -> **30-50%**
	- lower cost of capital than subordinated debt 
	- stricter covenants and more limitations
	- restrictive and maintenance covenants
	- often includes revolving credit facility
	- 2-3x EBITDA
	- (existing debts gets refinanced because of covenants)
	-> term loan A: amortized evenly over 5-7 years
	-> term loan B: nominal amortization with bullet last year (8+y)
	(defers repayment but more costly then term loan A)

3. High-yield debt ('Subordinated debt', typically unsecured) -> **20-30%**
	- high interest rates to compensate lenders
	- gets often refinanced when better terms available
	- bullet repayment with no amortization!
	- interest in cash or PIK (added to face value)
	- used by large firms because junk bond markets 
	
4. Mezzanine Debt
	- provided by private equity investors and hedge funds
	- combination: high-yield debt + warrants ("equity kicker")

Mezzanine financing is form of high-yield market for private companies

5. Seller Notes
	- buyer issues note to the seller that it agrees to repay over a fixed amount of time
	- cheaper than other forms of junior debt
	- receipt of sale proceeds is delayed (lower NPV)
	- shifts part of risk to seller 
	- => often used to bridge gap between seller and buyer

6. Securitization
	- cash flows attributable to assets can get securitized

7. Common equity -> **20-35% of capital**

> [!info] leverage ratios
> Total debt: 3.0x-6.0x EBITDA
> Interest coverage at least 2.0x EBITDA


see [[debt advisory interview]] and [[debt advisory]]

benefits of private equity and hedge funds providing funding:
- leverage drives need to improve operationg performance to meet debt service
- survive financial distress better than comparably leveraged firms since they can easily provide additional funds
- have good knowhow and can place good managers


impact of LBO's on target firm:
- net reduction in employment (cut costs and work more efficiently)
- increased R&D and capital spending 
- significantly improved operating performance (more access to capital)

advantages:
- management incentives (pressure to pay interest, or good pressure if they are equity investors in the lbo)
- better alignment between owner and manager (lbo sponsor)
- tax savings from interest expenses
- takeover defense: eliminated public investors (shares cannot be bought as easily)

disadvantages:
- raised breakeven point due to high interest payments
- increased vulnerability to business cycles
- potential problems to raise further capital

LBO deal structures:
1. direct merger: target firm is merged directly into firm controlled by financial sponsor (not often as impractical to later split off)
2. subsidiary merger: target firm is merged into acquisition subsidiary with the target surviving, it is now owned by the parent firm which is in turn controlled by the financial sponsor
3. reverse stock split: to reduce number of shareholders below 300 in order to force delisting from public exchanges


# Part V - Alternative business and restructuring
## 15 - Business Alliances
=> business alliances are a way of *implementing* business strategies!

motivations for business alliances:
- risk sharing  
- gain from other player: proprietary knowledge, management skills,...
- gain access to new markets: distribution channels other firm
- gain access to foreign markets where laws prohibit 100% foreign ownership or where cultural differences are substantial (eg: China)
- cost reductions: economies of scale, joint manufacturing
-> may hint to acquisition or exit 
-> may still be possible even in merger/acquisition is not possible due to regulator

critical success factors for an alliance:
- measurable synergies
- risk reduction (eg: shared costs)
- cooperation and clarity of purpase
- win-win situation
- compatible time frames and similar financial expectations

>[!Example]
>Firm A provides $30.0 bn (49.9% stake)
>Firm B provides $7.25 bn (50.1% stake)
>
 payment of $6.5 bn in cash to firm A
borrowing of $9.5 bn by subsidiary (firm B majority) and payment of it to firm A 
>
total payment firm A: $30.0 bn - $6.5 bn - $9.5 bn = $14.00 bn
total payment firm B: $7.25 bn + $6.5 bn + $9.5 bn = $23.25 bn
>
implied minority discount: $14.0/(49.9% x $37.5) = -21%
implied majority premium: $23.25/(51.1% x $37.5) = +20%

factors to take into account when developing legal structure:
- taxes
- limitations on liability
- control
- duration
- ease of ownership transfer
- ease of raising capital

=> many alliances fail so having a solid legal structure is necessary to handle conflict easily and avoid costly litigation

**joint ventures**
TYPES OF PARTNERSHIPS:
*general partnership*:
- short term alliances (3-5 years)
- \+ profit/loss and responsibilities allocated to partners
- \- partners have unlimited liability, partners are jointly/severally liable
- \- lacks continuity
- \- partnership interests illiquid

*private limited partnership*:
- \+ profit/losses allocated to partners
- \+ limited liability if one partner assumes unlimited liability
- \- lacks continuity, illiquid interests
- \- lacks financing flexibility as limited to 35 partners
-> hard to transfer ownership or raise financing

*limited liability companies*:
- \+ limited liability to partners, owners can be managers
- \+ avoids double taxation
- \+ allows unlimited number of owners, allows corporate shareholders
- \+ offers flexibility in allocating investments, profits and losses
- \- structure lacks continuity
- \- ownership shares illiquid as transfer needs to be approved by all members
- \- members must be active participants in the firm (no dormant investors)

**franchise alliances**
- \+ allows repeatable application of successful business model
- \+ minimizes start-up expenses
- \+ common brand and marketing strategy
- \- royalty payments for franchisee (3-7% of revenue)

**equity partnerships**
- \+ facilitates close working relationships without big investments
- \+ good to see if firm match for later merger
- \+ doesn't require financial statement consilidation if small percentage
- \- limited tactical and strategic control since minority stake

**written contracts**
- \+ not complex because no separate legal entity established
- \+ introduction to other firm
- \- limited control and lacks close coordination
- \- limited commitment since no real skin in the game


alliance deal structuring:
1. define tight scope with everything included
2. determine control and management framework
3. coordinate the resource contribution (tangible/intangible)
4. agree over profit/loss and tax benefit allocation
5. how will you settle disputes?
6. how will capital be financed in the future?
7. how will performance be measured and monitored?

## 16 - Divestitures, spin-offs, split-offs, equity carve-outs

MOTIVES 
**focus motive**
> [!paper] John and Ofek (1995)
>>  *divesting assets increases performance*
> 
-> divesting unrelated or underperfoming assets increases focus
-> performance of remaining assets improves
>
Firms that combine units with different growth paths and investment opportunities are more likely to spin-off or carve-off a unit
-> misallocation of investment funds increases as well

**Efficiency motive**
> [!paper] Matsusaka (2001)
>>  *managers look for and keep activities that fit with their capabilities*
>
dynamic organizational structure as units/segments that don't fit with the managers or are underperforming will be divested>
-> segments where manager has firm-specific knowledge will be more productive and larger
=> other segments will naturally underperform (and thus divested) even though it might just be that the manager is not good enough

**financial constraints motive**
divesting assets might just be the quickest and easiest way to raise cash, especially when business is performing badly (credit will be hard to obtain at good rates)

**reducing agency problems**
market corrects value-reducing diversification by lowering the firm value
-> activist investors might step in and require firm to divest/spin-off subsidiary
=> refocusing more in public than in private firms (lower agency problems) 

### **DIVESTITURES**
> [!danger] Explanation
> Sale of a portion of the firm to an outside party resulting in a cash infusion to parent. This is most common restructuring strategy.

motives for divestitures:
- increasing corporate focus by divesting unrelated assets
- moving away from core business by acquiring new businesses and divesting prior core business units
- selling assets that are in high demand but not used to its full extent at parent
- satisfy government requirements (eg: when acquiring other firm)
- correcting past mistakes

> [!paper] Schlingemann et al. (2002)
>> *Liquidity Hypothesis:* refocusing firms will divest assets if their segments are in industries that are more liquid
> 
>asset liquidity thesis: when decision to divest has been taken, most liquid segments will be sold 
>-> only valid if there is no other distinction between assets (eg margins) 
> 
units that are in financial distressed are more likely to be liquididated

| Selling Process | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- |
| 1 on 1 negotiations <Br> (single bidder) | - enables seller to select buyer with greatest synergy <Br> - minimizes disruptive due diligence <Br> - limits potential for loss due to leaking proprietary information |
| Public Auction <Br> (unlimited bidders) | - most appropriate for small, private or hard to value firms <Br> - may discourage bidders who don't like bidding uninformed <Br> - potentially more due diligence (multiple bidders) |
| controlled auction <Br> (limited selected bidders) | - competition without disruptive effects of public auctions <Br> - may exclude interested, non-selected, attractive bidders|


**SPIN-OFFS**
>[!danger] Explanation
> The subsidiary becomes a listed firm as well, with exactly the same shareholder base as the parent company. Since there is only a share distribution (and no cash inflow), there is no tax liability 

value creation:
1. more focused parent firm
2. subsidiary becomes 'pure play'
3. subsidiary is independent and can make own decisions, raise financing and invest in projects as it pleases -> eliminates agency and capital misallocation arguments ([[Notes#^6c153a]])
4. investors can choose in which company(-ies) they stay invested in, no more mandatory diversification
5. no due diligence necessary to spin-off company, no expensive roadshow


**EQUITY CARVE-OUTS**
>[!danger] Explanation
> A company sells a minority stake in one of its subsidiaries as a separate security. This can be done through an IPO (if subsidiary is private) or through a secondary offering (if subsidiary already publicly listed). 
> 
> The purpose of the equity carve-out is to raise additional capital (for company use or owner use). Since the sale of the stake generates cash, there are significant tax liabilities paired with it. There will be a tax liability on the capital gains of the carve-out, as well as on the dividends paid out to the shareholders. 

the shareholder base of the subsidiary will be different than the one of the parent (unlike with a spin-off) since the shares are offered to the public. 

the result of the subsidiary will be reflected more clearly than if it would be on the books of the mother company (eg Volkswagen and Porsche)

**TRACKING STOCKS**
>[!danger] Explanation
>A type of stock that is designed to track the financial performance of a specific unit within the company. They are used as a way for a company to raise capital without selling a controlling stake in the unit. However, they don't entitle the owner to any ownership stake in the division being tracked.   There is a tax implication, given that there is a capital raising.

can be used to provide managers of the unit with stock-based compensation
-> be wary of conflicts of interest (unit performance more important than firm)

benefits of being a pure play now

**SPLIT-OFF**
>[!danger] Explanation
>A variation of a spin-off in which parent company shareholders are given the option to exchange their shares for shares of the subsidiary. This is frequently used when the parent company doesn't have a 100% ownership in the subsidiary. There is no tax liability since there is no capital raised.

advantages:
- less pressure on spun-off firm's share price (voluntary shareholders)
- increase parent EPS (lower shares outstanding)
- eliminates subsidiaries with minority shareholders (if minority shareholders of subsidiary agree to swap shares with parent company shares)
(can go hand in hand with cash to persuade shareholders)
